    "## What Is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in python?\n",
    "In Python, OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and classes to create programs. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. These variables are often referred to as properties of the object, and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program. Main principles of OOPs in Python are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the ability to hide the implementation details of an object from the user, while still providing a simple and easy-to-use interface. Encapsulation refers to the practice of combining data and methods within a class to protect the data from external interference. Inheritance is a way to create new classes based on existing ones, allowing the new classes to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class. Finally, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, making it possible to write generic code that can work with a variety of objects."

    "## Example of OOPs\n",

    "For example, a car can be an object. If we consider the car as an object, its properties would be its color, model, price, brand, etc. And its behavior/function would be acceleration, slowing down, and gear change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example – If we consider a dog as an object then its properties would be its color, breed, name, weight, etc., and its behavior/function would be walking, barking, playing, etc."
